## Codebase Patterns
- Store migration governance decisions under `tasks/` and add a reference from `tasks/prd-migrate-feff10-to-rust-improved.md` for traceability.
- Keep story state consistent by updating `scripts/ralph/prd.json` (`passes`) and appending `scripts/ralph/progress.txt` in the same commit.

## 2026-02-16 17:00:00 JST - US-001
- Implemented the D-1 platform certification matrix with GA/non-GA OS+architecture targets, platform-specific compiler/runtime constraints, and an explicit approval record.
- Added a PRD traceability reference to the finalized D-1 decision log.
- Quality checks: `cargo check` passed.
- Files changed: `tasks/migration-decision-log.md`, `tasks/prd-migrate-feff10-to-rust-improved.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Decision-level migration constraints should live in dedicated docs under `tasks/` and be linked from the PRD.
  - Gotchas encountered: `scripts/ralph/progress.txt` may start without a `Codebase Patterns` section; create it at the top before appending story entries.
  - Useful context: Story execution state is controlled only by `passes` in `scripts/ralph/prd.json`; update just the completed story.
