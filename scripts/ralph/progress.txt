# Ralph Progress Log
## Codebase Patterns
- Treat `tasks/migration-contract-reference.md` as the single release-blocking contract index; update it whenever any linked contract artifact changes.
- On macOS arm64, run Rust quality gates with `CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_APPLE_DARWIN_LINKER="$(xcrun -f clang)"` to avoid `-liconv` linker failures in test binaries.
- Baseline snapshot access policy is governed by `tasks/migration-decision-log.md` D-5: runtime commands must not read/copy `artifacts/fortran-baselines`, while regression/capture/tests are the only approved baseline consumers.
- Route runtime CLI execution through `pipelines::execute_runtime_pipeline` plus `runtime_compute_engine_available`; keep baseline-backed module scaffolds isolated to regression/validation flows.
- For dual-run parity, use `feff10-rs oracle` to run `scripts/fortran/capture-baselines.sh --all-fixtures` and `run_regression` against the same manifest fixture set (`oracle-subdir` defaults to `outputs`).
- Regression JSON reports now expose `mismatch_fixtures` with per-artifact reason/path detail; use that section (and `render_human_summary`) for actionable oracle mismatch diagnostics.

## [2026-02-17 06:57:07 JST] - US-001
- Implemented a central migration contract index in `tasks/migration-contract-reference.md` that references the compatibility matrix, fixture manifest, numeric tolerance policy, boundary map, and D-4 error contract.
- Updated migration governance docs to declare the contract index as release-blocking for module rewrites.
- Files changed: `tasks/migration-contract-reference.md`, `tasks/prd-migrate-feff10-to-rust-improved.md`, `tasks/migration-decision-log.md`, `README.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Keep cross-artifact migration contracts centralized in one index document to avoid drift between PRD stories and implementation docs.
  - Gotchas encountered: Local macOS runs can fail tests with `ld: library not found for -liconv` unless the linker override in README is used.
  - Useful context: `US-001` is now satisfied by documentation-only changes; no runtime code paths were modified.
---
## [2026-02-17 07:01:00 JST] - US-002
- Added a normative D-5 decision defining baseline-copy runtime guardrails, explicitly prohibiting runtime reads/copies from `artifacts/fortran-baselines` for output generation.
- Updated the release-blocking contract index and operator/developer docs to state that baseline snapshots are allowed only in validation (`regression`, capture/snapshot tooling) and tests.
- Marked `US-002` as passing in `scripts/ralph/prd.json`.
- Files changed: `tasks/migration-decision-log.md`, `tasks/migration-contract-reference.md`, `docs/developer-workflows.md`, `docs/operator-guide.md`, `README.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Governance constraints that span runtime and tooling should be anchored in `tasks/migration-decision-log.md` and linked from `tasks/migration-contract-reference.md` so they remain release-blocking.
  - Gotchas encountered: This repository currently has no in-repo `AGENTS.md`, so reusable learnings must be recorded in `scripts/ralph/progress.txt` instead.
  - Useful context: Current module parity pipelines still materialize baseline outputs; they are now explicitly classified as validation-only paths under D-5 until compute rewrites land.

## [2026-02-17 07:10:07 JST] - US-003
- Added shared pipeline interfaces for runtime compute execution (`RuntimePipelineExecutor`) and validation execution (`ValidationPipelineExecutor`), plus a shared runtime dispatcher in `src/pipelines/mod.rs`.
- Refactored CLI runtime paths (`feff`, `feffmpi`, module commands) to use the runtime dispatcher and fail fast with deterministic `RUN.RUNTIME_ENGINE_UNAVAILABLE` when a module has no runtime compute engine; regression validation paths remain unchanged.
- Updated CLI compatibility tests and README runtime notes to reflect the runtime/validation split and current runtime-engine availability.
- Marked `US-003` as passing in `scripts/ralph/prd.json`.
- Files changed: `src/pipelines/mod.rs`, `src/cli/mod.rs`, `tests/cli_compatibility.rs`, `README.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Runtime boundary wiring is centralized in `src/cli/mod.rs` and should call `execute_runtime_pipeline` only; module scaffolds remain reusable for regression hooks and parity tests.
  - Gotchas encountered: On macOS arm64, `cargo test`/`cargo clippy` require `CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_APPLE_DARWIN_LINKER="$(xcrun -f clang)"` to avoid `-liconv` linker failures.
  - Useful context: `feff`/`feffmpi` now report unsupported runtime modules early instead of falling through validation-style scaffold execution.

## [2026-02-17 07:20:15 JST] - US-004
- Added a new validation-only CLI command, `feff10-rs oracle`, that runs Fortran capture (`scripts/fortran/capture-baselines.sh`) and then Rust-vs-oracle regression in one flow.
- Implemented oracle command parsing for capture mode (`--capture-runner` or `--capture-bin-dir`), oracle/actual/report path plumbing, and shared `--run-*` pre-compare hook flags to support Rust actual generation in the same command.
- Updated help/usage surfaces and workflow docs to include the new oracle command and explicitly keep it outside production runtime command paths.
- Added integration coverage for oracle plumbing in `tests/regression_cli.rs` and help-surface coverage in `tests/cli_compatibility.rs`.
- Quality checks passed: `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo check --locked`, `CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_APPLE_DARWIN_LINKER="$(xcrun -f clang)" cargo test --locked`, `CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_APPLE_DARWIN_LINKER="$(xcrun -f clang)" cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --all -- --check`.
- Marked `US-004` as passing in `scripts/ralph/prd.json`.
- Files changed: `src/cli/mod.rs`, `tests/regression_cli.rs`, `tests/cli_compatibility.rs`, `README.md`, `docs/developer-workflows.md`, `tasks/migration-decision-log.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Oracle dual-run wiring should reuse `RegressionRunnerConfig` and `--run-*` hook flags so capture and comparison stay aligned with existing regression contracts.
  - Gotchas encountered: Oracle capture requires exactly one execution mode (`--capture-runner` or `--capture-bin-dir`); missing or dual modes should fail fast as CLI usage errors.
  - Useful context: The `oracle` command resolves manifest/policy/output paths from the invocation directory and then executes capture from workspace root so script-relative paths remain stable.

## [2026-02-17 07:24:53 JST] - US-005
- Extended regression reporting with explicit mismatch aggregates (`mismatch_fixture_count`, `mismatch_artifact_count`) and a machine-readable `mismatch_fixtures` section containing per-artifact mismatch reason/baseline/actual detail.
- Updated human-readable regression/oracle summaries to print mismatch totals plus fixture-level and artifact-level mismatch lines, including actionable reason and path context.
- Added coverage in `src/pipelines/regression.rs` tests and `tests/regression_cli.rs` oracle integration test to verify mismatch details appear in both summary text and JSON reports.
- Quality checks passed: `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo check --locked`, `CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_APPLE_DARWIN_LINKER="$(xcrun -f clang)" cargo test --locked`, `CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_APPLE_DARWIN_LINKER="$(xcrun -f clang)" cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --all -- --check`.
- Marked `US-005` as passing in `scripts/ralph/prd.json`.
- Files changed: `src/pipelines/regression.rs`, `tests/regression_cli.rs`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Use `RegressionRunReport.mismatch_fixtures` rather than scanning all fixtures/artifacts when reporting parity failures in CLI or tooling surfaces.
  - Gotchas encountered: Fixture pass/fail thresholds can still mark a fixture as passing while artifact mismatches exist; mismatch reporting must be computed independently of fixture pass status.
  - Useful context: There are still no repository `AGENTS.md` files, so reusable workflow details continue to be captured in `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
