# Ralph Progress Log
## Codebase Patterns
- Treat `tasks/migration-contract-reference.md` as the single release-blocking contract index; update it whenever any linked contract artifact changes.
- On macOS arm64, run Rust quality gates with `CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_APPLE_DARWIN_LINKER="$(xcrun -f clang)"` to avoid `-liconv` linker failures in test binaries.

## [2026-02-17 06:57:07 JST] - US-001
- Implemented a central migration contract index in `tasks/migration-contract-reference.md` that references the compatibility matrix, fixture manifest, numeric tolerance policy, boundary map, and D-4 error contract.
- Updated migration governance docs to declare the contract index as release-blocking for module rewrites.
- Files changed: `tasks/migration-contract-reference.md`, `tasks/prd-migrate-feff10-to-rust-improved.md`, `tasks/migration-decision-log.md`, `README.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Keep cross-artifact migration contracts centralized in one index document to avoid drift between PRD stories and implementation docs.
  - Gotchas encountered: Local macOS runs can fail tests with `ld: library not found for -liconv` unless the linker override in README is used.
  - Useful context: `US-001` is now satisfied by documentation-only changes; no runtime code paths were modified.
