## Codebase Patterns
- Build `tasks/full-module-migration-ledger.csv` from `gap/fortran-to-rust-file-gap.csv` rows where `classification=out_of_scope`, preserving source order for deterministic chunking.
- Use `phase` as the owning PRD story ID (`US-xxx`) and split chunked directories by per-directory ledger order (ATOM 10/10/9, MATH 4/3, GENFMT 9/9, EELSMDFF 5/4).
- Current gap artifacts report `out_of_scope=102`; verify counts from the CSV before assuming the target value in narrative docs.
- Route FEFF legacy card-prefix handling through `crates/feff-core/src/support/common/itoken.rs` (`canonical_keyword_for_parser`) instead of duplicating per-parser alias maps.
- Normalize EDGE card values with `crates/feff-core/src/support/common/isedge.rs` so numeric aliases (`1`, `35`, etc.) collapse to canonical labels (`K`, `R3`, etc.).
- Port deferred low-level helper files into `crates/feff-core/src/support/<domain>/` and export from the domain `mod.rs` plus `support/mod.rs` so unit tests are discoverable through the main crate test suite.
- For Numerical Recipes-style helper ports, keep numeric assertions near `1e-9` unless the legacy routine uses tighter convergence tolerances than FEFF defaults.

## 2026-02-19 09:12:27 JST - US-001
- What was implemented
  - Added `tasks/full-module-migration-ledger.csv` with required columns and 102 `out_of_scope` rows mapped from `gap/fortran-to-rust-file-gap.csv`.
  - Assigned deterministic `rust_target` values under `crates/feff-core/src/support/<fortran_dir>/<fortran_file>.rs`.
  - Assigned deterministic `phase` ownership aligned to PRD user stories, including chunk splits for ATOM/MATH/GENFMT/EELSMDFF.
  - Set `status=pending` and blank `notes` for all ledger rows.
- Files changed
  - `tasks/full-module-migration-ledger.csv`
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
  - `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: The ledger order is meaningful for chunk stories; preserve the source CSV order when selecting chunk-A/chunk-B or thirds.
  - Gotchas encountered: PRD text says 103 deferred rows, but `gap/fortran-to-rust-file-gap.csv` and `gap/fortran-to-rust-gap-report.md` currently show 102 `out_of_scope` rows.
  - Useful context: Validation gates used and passing in this iteration: `cargo check --locked`, `cargo test --locked`, `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --all -- --check`.

## 2026-02-19 09:27:39 JST - US-002
- What was implemented
  - Added Rust support ports for deferred `COMMON` files (`getxk`, `isedge`, `itoken`, `nxtunt`, `pertab`, `xx`) and deferred `ERRORMODS/m_errorstackmod` under `crates/feff-core/src/support/...`.
  - Wired shared support code into active FEFF-core paths: parser keyword normalization now accepts FEFF-style 4-character prefixes via `itoken`, and RDINP edge extraction now canonicalizes edge aliases via `isedge`.
  - Added targeted unit tests for the migrated support modules and parser/RDINP integrations.
  - Marked all `US-002` ledger rows (`COMMON` + `ERRORMODS`) as `status=done`.
- Files changed
  - `crates/feff-core/src/lib.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/parser/mod.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/modules/rdinp/parser.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/mod.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/common/mod.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/common/getxk.rs`

  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/common/xx.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/errormods/mod.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/errormods/m_errorstackmod.rs`
  - `tasks/full-module-migration-ledger.csv`
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
  - `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: The new `support/common` modules are safe places to port shared Fortran helpers before wiring them through parser/module layers.
  - Gotchas encountered: `parse_potentials` must accept inline values on both `POTENTIAL` and `POTENTIALS` cards when parser alias normalization maps legacy prefixes to canonical names.
  - Useful context: Validation gates used and passing in this iteration: `cargo check --locked`, `cargo test --locked`, `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --all -- --check`.

## 2026-02-19 09:36:51 JST - US-003
- What was implemented
  - Added Rust ports for MATH chunk-A helpers under `crates/feff-core/src/support/math/`: `cwig3j`, `determ`, `dist`, and `quartc` with Fortran-compatible core formulas and argument-domain checks.
  - Wired the new math support module into `support/mod.rs` and added the new dependency required for complex-valued quartic roots.
  - Added deterministic unit tests for each migrated helper covering known-value cases, error-domain behavior, and quartic root residual validation.
  - Marked `US-003` MATH chunk-A ledger rows (`cwig3j`, `determ`, `dist`, `quartc`) as `status=done`.
- Files changed
  - `Cargo.toml`
  - `Cargo.lock`
  - `crates/feff-core/Cargo.toml`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/mod.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/math/mod.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/math/cwig3j.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/math/determ.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/math/dist.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/math/quartc.rs`
  - `tasks/full-module-migration-ledger.csv`
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
  - `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: New deferred helpers should be exported through both `support/<domain>/mod.rs` and `support/mod.rs` to ensure crate-level test discovery and predictable import paths.
  - Gotchas encountered: The FEFF quartic routine assumes non-degenerate coefficient combinations; tests should validate by polynomial residual and avoid coefficient sets that collapse the legacy closed-form denominator path.
  - Useful context: Validation gates used and passing in this iteration: `cargo check --locked`, `cargo test --locked`, `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --all -- --check`.

## 2026-02-19 09:50:03 JST - US-004
- What was implemented
  - Added Rust support ports for deferred MATH chunk-B helpers (`rotwig`, `sdist`, `xlogx`), EXCH helper (`ffq`), and TDLDA elliptic helpers (`ellpi`, `rf`, `rj`, `rc`) under `crates/feff-core/src/support/...`.
  - Added new support domains `exch` and `tdlda`, exporting them via `crates/feff-core/src/support/mod.rs`, and wired new math helpers through `crates/feff-core/src/support/math/mod.rs`.
  - Added deterministic unit tests for each migrated helper covering closed-form values, symmetry/branch behavior, and invalid-argument handling.
  - Marked all `US-004` ledger rows (`EXCH/ffq`, `MATH/rotwig`, `MATH/sdist`, `MATH/xlogx`, `TDLDA/ellfun`) as `status=done`.
- Files changed
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/mod.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/math/mod.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/math/rotwig.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/math/sdist.rs`
  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/math/xlogx.rs`

  - `crates/feff-core/src/support/tdlda/ellfun.rs`
  - `tasks/full-module-migration-ledger.csv`
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
  - `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: FEFF/Numerical Recipes elliptic routines (`rc/rf/rj`) converge to stable values with the original errtol settings but should be validated with realistic tolerances (~`1e-9`) instead of machine-epsilon expectations.
  - Gotchas encountered: Running `cargo fmt --all` before the final gate command avoids avoidable `fmt --check` failures on multiline numeric expressions in newly added support helpers.
  - Useful context: Validation gates used and passing in this iteration: `cargo check --locked`, `cargo test --locked`, `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --all -- --check`.
