 Preparing plane wave scattering amplitudes...
 Searching for paths...
    Rmax  2.0000  keep and heap limits   0.0000000   0.0000000
    Preparing neighbor table
    Paths found        0   (maxheap, maxscatt       3   2)
 Eliminating path degeneracies...
    Plane wave chi amplitude filter   2.50%
    Unique paths      0,  total paths       0
 Done with module 4: pathfinder.
